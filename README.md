This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

##Application
Conversor Numeric to Roman or Roman to Numeric. 

##Improvements
I will add more validations for the numeric to roman conversor, for example, check if the number is like XX.XX.
I will improve the design and when there is an error show a red message.
I will add more test cases for catching errors in the numeric to roman functionality 
I will split more the code creating modules and functions.
